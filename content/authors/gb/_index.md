I am Guillermo Echegoyen, senior researcher at [Expert AI](https://www.expert.ai/). My research interests concern Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Computer Science, with special focus on question answering, machine reading comprehension, language models, deep neural networks and lifelong learning.

In 2018, I obtained my MSc in Artificial Intelligence by the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), standing out in Evolutionary Computation, Multi Agent Systems and Bayesian networks.

When not in front of a computer, you can usually find me playing drums or rock climbing.
